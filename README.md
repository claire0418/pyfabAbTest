# pyfab

**pyfab** is a python GUI for a holographic optical trapping system.
When integrated with appropriate hardware, it presents a live video
image of the system being controlled together with graphical representations
of traps that are being projected into that system.  Traps can be
interactively added and deleted, grouped and translated.

**jansen** is the video front end for **pyfab** and stands alone as a
light-weight interface for holographic video microscopy.
