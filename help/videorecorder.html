    <h2>Video Recorder</h2>
    <p>
      The video recorder panel acts as a digital video recorder.</p>

    <p>
      Clicking the Record button creates a video file whose name
      is listed in the file name box, and starts recording video frames
      into that file.  An existing file will be overwritten.</p>

    <p>
      Clicking the Stop button stops recording and closes the video file.</p>

    <p>
      The frame counter presents the current number of frames
      in the video file.</p>

    <p>
      Clicking on the file name box launches a file selection dialog
      that can be used to change the name of the video file.</p>

    <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
    <p>
      Typing "r" starts recording.  Typing "s" stops recording.
      Typing "R" brings up the file selection dialog.</p>
