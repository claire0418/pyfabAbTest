<h2>Video Filters</h2>
<p>A video filter performs an operation on each frame coming
from the video camera and then passes along the transformed
frame for further filtering or for display.
Filters are applied sequentially in the order they are selected.
Some "filters" may not change an image, but instead might extract
information.</p>

<p>Select a filter by clicking on its check box</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Median</dt>
  <dd>Performs a running median filter on the image stream.  Moving
    objects disappear and the stationary background remains.
  </dd>

  <dt>Normalize</dt>
  <dd>Divide (normalize) each frame with a running median.  This
    emphasizes moving foreground features and suppresses the
    static background.
  </dd>

  <dt>Sample and Hold</dt>
  <dd>Estimate the background with a running median filter and then
    use that estimate to normalize subsequent frames.
  </dd>
</dl>
