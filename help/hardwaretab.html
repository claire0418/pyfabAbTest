<h2>Hardware Tab</h2>
The hardware tab appears if the interface detects suitable
instrumentation.

<h3>Control panels</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Stage</dt>
  <dd>The stage control displays the current x, y and z position
    of the translation stage and axial positioner.  A STOP button
    is provided to halt the stage's motion in emergencies.

  <dt>Laser</dt>
  <dd>This panel presents the current state of the IPG fiber laser
    that powers optical traps.  This component is potentially
    dangerous, and should be handled with care.  The panel has
    four LED enunciators that indicate the status of the laser's
    keyswitch, the pointing laser, the main laser, and current
    fault conditions.  The laser will not emit if the keyswitch
    indicator is dark.  The keyswitch must be turned on by hand.
    Clicking the buttons associated with the pointing laser and
    the main laser toggle those lasers on and off.  The power meter
    indicates the main laser's current emission power in watts.
