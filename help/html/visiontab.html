    <h2>Vision Tab</h2>
    <p>
      The vision tab provides capability for end-to-end holographic tracking
      and characterization both in real-time and after a video is recorded.
    </p>

    <p>
      After recording video, data can be exported as <tt>pylorenzmie</tt> <tt>Videos</tt>,
      containing <tt>Frames</tt> and <tt>Trajectories</tt>. <tt>Frames</tt> contain the <tt>Features</tt>
      found in each frame, and <tt>Trajectories</tt> contain <tt>Features</tt> representing
      the same feature in as many frames that it appears.
    </p>

    <p>
      If either the Estimate or Refine pipelines are chosen, then the z(t) vs. t
      Trajectory plot and a_p vs n_p probability distribution are populated with data
      from the video.
