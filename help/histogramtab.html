    <h2>Histogram Tab</h2>
    <p>
      The histogram tab has three real-time displays.
      The upper display presents the histogram of pixel intensities, N(I),
      which is the number of pixels in the image with intensity I.
      The middle panel presents the horizontal intensity profile, I(x),
      averaged over the vertical coordinate, y.
      The bottom panel presents the complementary vertical intensity profile,
      I(y).</p>

    <p>
      The displays update with every video frame so long as the
      histogram tab is visible.</p>
