<h2>How to Work with Traps</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Create a trap</dt>
  <dd>by holding the SHIFT key while right-clicking on the screen.
    A marker will appear on the screen (approximately) where the
    trap is projected.  In addition, an entry for the new trap
    will appear in the <a href="traptab.html">trap tab</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Move a trap (or a group of traps)</dt>
  <dd>by left-dragging the trap's marker.  The
    selected trap's marker will turn red as it is being moved,
    and will turn green again when the mouse button is released.
    Alternatively, the trap's position can be changed with
    controls in the <a href="traptab.html">trap tab</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Move a trap in 3D</dt>
  <dd>by placing the mouse over the trap's marker and
    scrolling the mouse wheel.  The axial (z) position can be
    monitored and set precisely with the <a href="traptab.html">trap tab</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Delete a trap (or a group of traps)</dt>
  <dd>by holding the CONTROL key while right-clicking on the
    trap's marker.  The marker will disappear, and the
    trap's information will disappear from the
    <a href="traptab.html">trap tab</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Gather traps into a group</dt>
  <dd>by left-dragging the mouse on the screen to create
    a "rubber-band" box around the traps.  Markers in the group
    will turn yellow while being gathered, and return to green
    after the mouse button is released.  After this, the entire
    group can be moved simultaneously by left-dragging or
    scrolling any of the traps in the group.
    Individual traps can still be moved within a group using
    the <a href="traptab.html">trap tab</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>Remove traps from a group</dt>
  <dd>by holding the CONTROL key while left-clicking the trap
    to be removed.  This trap will now move independently of
    the rest of the group.
  </dd>
